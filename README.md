# PRODIGY_CS_03
This project involves the development of a Python-based tool designed to assess the strength of user-provided passwords. The tool evaluates passwords based on several key criteria, including length, the presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numerical digits, and special characters. By analyzing these factors, the tool provides users with valuable feedback on the strength and security of their chosen passwords.
The tool checks passwords against multiple criteria to determine their strength. 

Length: Longer passwords are generally more secure.

Character Variety: The inclusion of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters enhances password complexity.

User Feedback: After assessment, the tool provides clear and actionable feedback to users, indicating whether their password is weak, moderate, or strong. Suggestions for improvement are also offered to help users create more secure passwords.

User -Friendly Interface: The tool features a simple command-line interface that allows users to easily input their passwords and receive immediate feedback.
